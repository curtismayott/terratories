# Charitable Giving

The third and final front of our objectives is charitable giving. In our world today, there are dozens of countries living with unexploded ordnance (UXO) and landmines decades after wars have ended. These invisible weapons are killing and maiming humans, as well as affecting local food sources and agriculture.

If Terratories is about terraforming in the game, then we see an opportunity to also terraform in the real world. Together we can make a direct impact in helping communities clear their land and allow humans to live again without fear. 

We will take 20% of all secondary sales and set it aside for donations to various non-profit organizations focused on safely clearing these devices and bringing life back to affected communities. Donations to these groups will be paid out on a quarterly basis. Some of these organizations include The HALO Trust, Mines Advisory Group (MAG), The Marshall Legacy Institute (MLI), APOPO, Norwegian Peoples Aid (NPA), and Spirit of Soccer.
