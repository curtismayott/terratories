# Objectives

The purpose of the Terratories NFT Experience is simply to get users engaged with the world outside – educate and exercise through entertainment. This will be achieved through three fronts. 

## Purpose & Experience

The first front will focus on the development of our mobile app by rolling it out in the preceding phased approach. We want to create an experience that generates a curiosity for the vastness of our planet and encourages players to explore the natural wonders of our world through biological zones. Exploration of our own backyard, neighborhood, village, city, region, country, continent, and globe all contribute to the experience of Terratories NFT. If we have created an inkling for you to be outside more often to pursue a fresh breath of oxygen, then we have succeeded. 

## Gallery & Education

The second front will pursue a more educational approach by examining life in our world and breaking down the bions we’ve created for our narrative. There are so many talented landscape photographers that have captured our planet in enhanced images. We will set aside funds  to procure photographers’ NFTs that depict landscapes of our bions. We will create a collection where we can showcase these in the metaverse to highlight one bion at a time. We will find an appropriate gallery to display these images, bring more life to the narrative by asking biological professionals for facts about our bions, and present the information in a digestible format. 

This front looks to integrate two communities of the blockchain. We believe this endeavor will allow us to support artists in the space while benefiting the vision of our objectives. 

The second front will not kick off as quickly as the first. More information on dates and timeline will be available after we launch.
