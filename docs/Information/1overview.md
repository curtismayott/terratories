# Overview

Terratories NFT is an experience we’ve created that takes a pinch of fantasy and adds it to the modern world. History is drenched in many mysteries, and we may never truly understand why particular events took place or the reasons things became what they’ve become. We’ve taken the opportunity to look at some of these historical events, come up with some of our own explanations , and provided the foundation for a saga to be constructed on the basis of this new innovative piece of technology called  blockchain. 

Blockchain in its simplest terms is a public ledger. Information, data, and proof of ownership can all be sent across this digital public ledger by various means of confirming transactions. There are many blockchains in existence in the world today. Some of these examples include Ethereum, Flow, Solana, WAX, Avalanche, and Cardano. Each of these blockchains have their own means of confirmation, but essentially once this verification process is accomplished, a record is created on the blockchain that will forever be blazed into the architecture. Anyone will be able to go back to review transactions, view how assets move around, but, most importantly, show ownership of an asset on the chain. 

There are two types of tokens that move through blockchain, fungible and non-fungible. Fungible Tokens (FT) are related to coins and currency exchanged across the chain. They might serve as the language of a particular blockchain where, in order to execute a transaction, the currency must be spent, or they might be a stable coin constructed to maintain an equal value to fiat (USD, EUR, JPY, etc) currency. They are the coins you would find on an exchange and swap for other coins. 

A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) would represent a unique string of letters that is tied to a digital asset. This could be a picture, a GIF, a video, anything that wouldn’t fall into the FT category. The innovation of blockchain technology means digital goods created, procured, earned, etc. can fall under the ownership of an individual and denote where it originated, who had possession, and if there was any monetary value involved in its exchange.  

## To summarize and provide a more simple explanation in their simplest terms - 

Fungible Tokens: Cryptocurrencies.
Non-Fungible Tokens: Units of data that represents a digital asset tied to the blockchain. 

## Two Components

Terratories NFT will have two main components rolled out in several phases. The first component will be our generative art NFTs called, The Speakers. These images will be sold to those who believe in our vision and who would like access to exclusive perks as the vision is rolled out. The second component is the Terratories NFT experience that will bring players outdoors, give users an experience of blockchain innovation, and provide education about our world, its landscapes and its fauna. 

The Speakers will be minted on the Ethereum blockchain because this chain has received the most adoption out of all blockchains to date and is home to where a majority of users utilizing this technology can be found. The Terratories NFT experience, however, has yet to land on a  particular blockchain. The reason being that blockchain technology is continuously innovating, and we have some time to make this decision. When the time comes, we want to do a side by side of all blockchain features before selecting. At a minimum the blockchain needs to be eco-friendly, have gasless transactions (no fee required to send  transactions on the blockchain), and offer scalability.
