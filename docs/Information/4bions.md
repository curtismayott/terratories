# Bions

The Earth is comprised of numerous biological landscapes (bions). These landscapes are divided up into categories based on temperature, composition of flora and fauna in an area, and geographical location. There are numerous definitions for how to categorize a landscape as well as many schools of thought behind how many landscapes we have on Earth. One thought process could give broad classifications to landscapes such as jungle, desert, mountain, while another school of thinking may take jungle and create numerous zones based on location and rainfall.  At Terratories we have settled on 21 active landscapes in the world today – Some of this is based on research, but some of this is also based on the narrative’s foundation. We have found unique identifiers for the lands we use and look to explore these identifiers more in depth.   

All of our bions will be revealed prior to the launch of Phase II. As of now, we have revealed seven bions to generate interest around the project.

## Ancients
Ancients are dragon-like guardians that oversee the existence and well-being of a bion. Their features reflect the composition of their landscape with some even having flora growing from their scales. They have been around for as long as Earth has existed . No one knows where they came from or how they were created – they’ve always been. The symbiotic relationship of Ancient and landscape keeps Earth whole and thriving.

Humans formed a bond with Ancients when they first crossed paths all those years ago. When humans are immersed in nature and present, the Ancients are given a spiritual foundation that helps strengthen their connection with the planet and empowers their abilities. When humans are pulled away from nature and given distractions to stay indoors and not interact with the outside, the foundation for Ancients to stand on is pulled away and the landscapes they protect become  vulnerable for destruction. 

A weakened Ancient equates to a weakened landscape.  Vice versa, a landscape weakened with pollution, deforestation, drought, etc,  equates to a weakened Ancient. Should a landscape or an Ancient be destroyed, the other also perishes. Our narrative states there used to be hundreds of bions on our planet, but many were destroyed in the Great War and through the preceding years. When Ancients were being hunted and killed during the war, their landscapes disappeared from the throngs of history. Remnants of these old landscapes can be found in different corners of the world but many have been blown from existence like the sands of time. 

After the Great War the remaining Ancients took to hiding away from humans who  could no longer be trusted and were discrete in their movements to not be seen by humans over the preceding years. Ancients were massive and even with their best efforts were still seen from time to time throughout history. It is thought many ancient civilizations intertwined sightings of Ancients into their own myths and inscribed images of Ancients into their temples. Some of these civilizations called them deities, built religions and cultural rituals around myths of these serpent-like creatures, and embraced the idea of supernatural beings living among humans. 

The remaining 21 Ancients are the weakest they have ever been. Humans are choosing to stay indoors in the comfort of our homes and are disconnected from nature, landscapes are polluted beyond recognition, and The Torch (the organization seeking the destruction of all Ancient’s on Earth) are pulling all the strings with members of the Crusade holding positions of power to carry out their agenda of locating the Ancients’ hiding spots. 

The Ancients recognize their only hope for survival is to trust and reconnect  with the humans who have the Speaker’s Gift blood gene. These are the ancestors of the Speakers they first gifted when humans and Ancient’s bonded millennia ago.
