# The Experience

Multiple things are involved in the production of Terratories.

Terratories NFT will deliver an experience combining blockchain with the outside world. You will select your bion, build cairns anywhere you choose to explore, raise up elems, and fight to terraform Earth in order to strengthen your Ancient. The Torch is coming..

## The Phases

There are a total of six phases. Phase I is for our Speakers NFT, followed by phases of Exploration, Harvesting, Marketplace, Terraforming, and Ancients & The Torch. 

### Speaker NFT

The Speakers are our generative art NFT series of over XXX traits brought to life by the Rive Gauche art studio from Paris, France. The Speakers are meant to feel like a group of humans that are caught up in a deeper truth they don’t quite understand. They are the resistance to a greater secret that is slowly coming to light in the world today. We’ve attempted to create a diverse set of characters every person finds relatable.  

The minting of our Speakers is the first phase of the Terratories saga. The mint cost will be XXX and they will become a token for future benefits as we build out our experience. Purchasing a Speaker NFT will grant buyers with a number of Cairn Placement NFTS (more information below) and exclusive access to certain digital materials that will be tied to the traits of their Speaker, both of which will be airdropped at the start of Phase II. 

### Exploration

The second phase of our Experience begins with what we wanted to achieve when we first started brainstorming Terratories – get people outside to take a deep breath of oxygen and explore their own backyards. An immersive digital world for gaming, education, dating, markets, and other social experiments is in the very near future. With Terratories we hope to link the digital world with reality by integrating our present world and innovative blockchain technology.

A cairn is a pile of rocks built by humans to indicate a trail marker or the top of a mountain summit. Cairns appear all over the world and were even used in prehistoric times as grave markers. They can be found in all different sizes and in various shapes. The cairn is the perfect device for us to embrace at Terratories - it is easy to construct, has historic ties to the world, the materials are manufactured by Earth, and they appear in all corners of the globe. In our story cairns are placed to generate mena (energy used to summon the elem) from the bion they are built upon. The cairn is therefore a critical piece to our Exploration phase. 

Players will be given Cairn Placement NFTS. These NFTs are consumable NFTs that are meant to be used outdoors to convert a position on the map into a cairn. The NFT identifies a player's  coordinates and creates a new NFT based on the player’s geo location. Players will select a bion for the cairn they are placing to create a ring of influence around their cairn. No other cairns can be placed within 333 feet of a cairn. We set this distance so players can get more exercise while moving from one interaction to the next. 

Upon placing the cairn, a player will create a unique badge and name for their cairn. These are identifiers for your cairn that no other player will be able to duplicate. The badge will be created in a generator from pre-designed shapes, symbols, and emblems. A player will select the art they want to use in which location of their badge and, once stoked about their design, submit the badge to the blockchain. Once a badge combination is used, the system will alert other players of a taken configuration should they try to use the same. 

A map will be accessible for users to see where all cairns are placed so they know what areas are available. Has Mount Denali been taken? Has Mount  Kilimanjaro been taken? The map will show all of this information as you look across the globe. A digital cairn can be placed anywhere (except for private land). Your placement of a cairn provides you with a digital  asset of the area where you placed your cairn. 

### Badges

Badges are customized identifiers players generate upon creating a cairn. There will be a generic set of symbols, emblems, and designs for every player to utilize. Players who own a Speaker NFT will have access to exclusive designs based on the traits of their Speaker. Other designs will become available during events, promos, and for achieving certain quests. 

The badges will serve as a passport stamp for players visiting cairns. Starting in Phase III, each player will be given a passport upon partaking in the Terratories experience. The first time a player visits a cairn, their passport will be stamped to indicate they have visited the location. If a player goes back a second time, they will receive a tally mark to show the number of visits a cairn is frequented. This information will show which cairns are the most frequented and popular. Players can also see which cairns they’ve interacted with the most. 

### Placement

Our app will not have any restrictions in placing a cairn (unless we can map out all the private land), but we do ask players to take  a tactful approach in their placements. Placing a cairn will draw in other players, and the locations set up will ultimately be tied to a player’s experience and the overall Terratories community. Upon placing a cairn, users will have to agree to a full set of terms to verify the location is a safe location and does not offer any hazards. While we may not initially know if a cairn is on private property, we will find out, and take action.

For the best experience, we ask players to think about placing cairns in public areas showcasing a part of town or unique experience a traveler would find interesting. A few suggestions are outside of your favorite restaurant, on a lake, in the ocean, on a mountain, at a trailhead, by your favorite bench, on the beach, by a unique house, a series along a bike path, where you were engaged/married, by your favorite piece of art/sculpture or museum, at an airport or train station, historical sites, that one covered bridge in town, an area while cross country skiing, on a gondola ride, and so much more. 

When placing your cairn you will be able to give it a rating on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. These stars will indicate how difficult it was to get to your location. Is it on top of a mountain, off trail, and does it require ice axes to get there? Then it’s 5 stars. Did you jump out of a car and travel ten feet to the location? That is going to be a 1 star. Players who come to visit your cairn will be asked how difficult it was to get to the location. As more people visit, an average difficulty rating will give future visitors a better idea of difficulty.  

### Superior Cairns

Our team will place unique cairns around the world that include unlockable content only accessible by visiting in person. These will be strategic locations  placed at some of the most beautiful natural places on Earth. Each one is intended to highlight the area of a bion in its natural element. They may not always be the easiest to get to, but they will be a memorable trip for any Speakers that wish to make the journey. 

### Harvesting

Phase III opens with an airdrop of our in-game resource mena. This will be available to players who have placed cairns and have helped build up the overall experience. Players can now begin to visit other cairns, receive badge stamps on their passports, collect mena from cairns you own and cairns placed by others. 

Mena accumulation will depend on several factors. The difficulty of the cairn is based  on our peer review system, how frequently the cairn is visited (the more frequent it is visited the less it will generate), and how far away the cairn is located from others. The latter factor will not weigh as heavily  as the other two, but we want to provide incentive for a cairn that may be isolated and tough to get to if no other cairns are nearby. 

### Marketplace

The market is now open! All the mena you have collected  can now be spent at our marketplace. The market will have physical goods (i.e. merchandise), Cairn Placement NFTs, and new designs that can be unlocked for future badges. Other opportunities include the occasional excursion promotion where players can spend mena to enter a raffle and the winner will receive free air and hotel. 

In addition, players can begin procuring items for the next phase;  Terraforming. These items will include elems for the bion you’ve selected and defensive items to help bolster the defenses of your cairn. We want the experience of Terratories to be multi-pronged – one avenue to offer an in-depth outdoor adventure mobile game and the other to offer outside exploration and exercise. The marketplace will reflect items for either path. 

### Terraforming

The gaming experience of Terratories is now active. Players will train their elem to terraform their neighborhoods and conquer opposing cairns (this does not convert ownership of the cairn, only the land in which the cairn sits), use the influence of friendly cairns to be a pillar for the bion, defend their lands, and to fight over a series of seasons to claim numerous awards and unlockable content.  

### Ancients & The Torch
